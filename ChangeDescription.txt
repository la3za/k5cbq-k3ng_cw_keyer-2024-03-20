I'm using the CW Training Functionality of the K3NG keyer to increase accuracy and speed. Sometimes, if I train at a speed a little above my comfort level, I experienced that I was never able to transmit the sequence correctly. And the keyer just kept on hitting me with the same sequence over and over again. Finally, I had to break out of the training mode and restart it again.

Therefore I wanted these modes to give up and move on in a soft way. A new variable PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS (in keyer_settings.h) will take care of that. A value of 4 means that the keyer moves on to the next word after 4 failed attempts. This is the value I use. Other values are: 1 to let it it move on at the first failure, and a large value, say 100, will give the old behavior where it just keeps hitting you with the same word over and over again.

This takes a few changed code lines in k3ng_keyer.ino. The reference is code version "2024.03.20.2239":

Command Mode U Receive / Send Echo Practice:
- lines 8519-20: change "loop2 = 1;" to
    		loop2 = PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS;     // Command Mode rx/tx practice (U); was 1 LA3ZA; 

- line 8616: 	after send_char(' ',0);
		add loop2 = PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS; // new code line, reset counter for number of errors; LA3ZA 

- line 8642: 	after if (correct_answer_led) digitalWrite(correct_answer_led, LOW); 
		add loop2 = loop2-1;               // new code line, count down number of attempts; LA3ZA


Command Line Interface, Receive / Transmit Echo Practice, Progressive 5 Character Groups:

- line 15008-10: replace loop2 = 1;
    		 loop2 = PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS; // CLI - RX/Tx Practice, Progressive; was 1, LA3ZA

- line 15134: 	after send_char(' ',0);
		add loop2 = PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS;   // new code line, reset counter for no of errors; LA3ZA

- line 15152:   after if (correct_answer_led) digitalWrite(correct_answer_led, LOW);  
		add loop2 = loop2-1;                 // new code line, count down number of attempts; LA3ZA

Command Line Interface, Keyboard Interactive Receive Practice

- line 15810	replace loop2=1; with
		loop2 = PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS; // CLI, keyboard practice I, was 1, LA3ZA

- line 15868	after
			service_display();
            	#endif
		loop2 = loop2-1;              // new code line, count down number of attempts; LA3ZA
		

What is left to do is something I haven't succeeded in doing and that is to implement the same functionality for "Command Line Interface, Receive / Transmit Echo Practice" and callsigns, 2,3,4 letter words, QSO words etc. It starts in line 15989 where loop2=1; needs to be replaced with loop2 = PRACTICE_MAX_ATTEMPTS; So far I haven't been able to find where to put "loop2 = loop2-1;" in the following while (loop2) loop.

I found what was needed for the countdown and soft exit for the practice mode with callsigns etc also:


port_to_use->println();

          #ifdef FEATURE_DISPLAY

            display_scroll_print_char(' ');

            service_display();

          #endif

          loop2 = loop2-1;              // new code line, count down number of attempts; LA3ZA

The additional last line is line 15101 in my (modified) code
